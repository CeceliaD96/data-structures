//Linear Data Structures
Final Project
December 2017
Prompt:
Create a program that will read a text file, and place each token(or word) into a given data structure. 
Data structures are to be written completely by the student.

The data structures are as follows:
-Unsorted Linked List
-Sorted Linked List
-Modified Sorted Linked List
-Front Self-Adjusting Linked List (places each added item at the front of the linked list)
-Single Self-Adjusting Linked List (moves each added item up a single space in the linked list)
-Skip Lists
-Binary Tree

Record the time it takes to place each file into the data structure as well as the number of comparisons,
and the number of reference changes. These numbers will be used when analyzing the data.

Write a final report analyzing all the data.
